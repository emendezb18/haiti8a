        <center><img src="lake.jpeg"></center>
        <p>Located 18 miles east of Port-au-Prince is Lake Azué. It is the third largest lake in the Caribbean islands and the largest lake in Haiti, and it borders Haiti's neighbor, the Dominican Republic. It covers 65 kilometers of land , is a magnificent ecosystem, and is a perfect place to start outdoor adventures. So many Haitians that live close to the lake use the lake to collect water and take it to their homes because Haiti is in a difficult situation regarding water and the government does not have the capacity of resources and money to give water to those people that don’t have it. In recent years, the river has grown after the heavy rains and hurricanes that have occurred in Haiti in recent years. The lake each year grows a few centimeters, and this is dangerous to the towns that are close to the lake .
        
            The river has so many rich things, like commercial tilapia. There are many different types of tilapia.Also in the lake are farms and groups of waterfowl that were once hunted but are now protected by law. If you one day visit the lake, you will find a group of fishermen that will offer you a tour through this lake to support themselves and their families, because the fishing they do every day is not enough to support their own families.
