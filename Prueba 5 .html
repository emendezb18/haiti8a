        <p>The greatest waterfall in Haiti, Saut-Mathurine, is one of the many undiscovered things that Haiti has on the south coast. The river that feeds Saut Mathurine, the Cavaillon, flows strongly during the rainy season, and you can hear the thunderous falls from a distance. The pool is still a lovely spot to swim in, and the forest view is just as pretty and spectacular as it is during the rainy season, even though January is Haiti's driest month.
            This waterfall is unique and more exotic than the other normal waterfalls in Haiti because, at the opposite end of the waterfall, the water spills over the side of the pool and forms rapids that flow deeper into the valley. The hills of the river are covered in tall native trees, and the sounds of exotic birds mix with the sounds of the waterfall. This waterfall has many tourists since many people work hard and come to the waterfalls to relax and have a good time. These waterfalls are important for Haiti because this country has a great variety of different waterfalls, and it is very good for tourists to come and visit them, and with that money, help the most needy in the country, such as through the resources of the Haitian government.
