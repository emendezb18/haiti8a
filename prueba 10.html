        <p>Who doesn't like to dance? Listen to different types of music and dance for hours. Well, Haitians think the same. In Haiti, it is a country where carnivals are very common but dances are rare. Well, Haitian music has all kinds of rhythms, like vibrant, most of the time, it is religious or political in nature. This kind of music has French, African, and even Spanish influences. In Haiti, a very popular jazz-based dance music called kompa was created in the middle of the 20th century.
            If one day you are going to visit Haiti and you no longer know what to do, you have to go to Fubar, PÃ©tion-Ville, and Presses Cafe to listen to the best DGs and dance for a very long time. In these places, you will find the best places to show off your dance moves and have fun with your group of friends. It is a favorite flashback of Haitians going to this club at night. You will find different kinds of music there, like old music and records. It is highly recommended to go with friends in case you do not know anyone else there, and there is a lot of security in this sona since it is one of the best sonas in the capital.
