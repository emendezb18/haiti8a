        <p>Do you like history? Well, you are in luck because in Port-au-Prince you can find the national museum of Pantheon or MUPANAH, a under-gorund place where you can see the history of Haiti in a short time since the place is small but very complete. There you will find a summary of the facts that have marked the history of this country to get an idea and better understand the current situation in which it is found. This will be achieç´´ved through a journey from some original settlers to the present, with special emphasis on the process of independence. 

            The museum has guides who speak several languages. It is quite small but has interesting things, a nice place to know a little about the history of Haiti. It is also a place full of very important images that the guides will explain to you in addition to having an audio visual room to relieve everything. You can see the anchor of one of the “caravelas” of Cristopher Columbus among other important things. It is very well designed and well informed so that tourists and their visitors learn all about the origins and culture of Haiti.
