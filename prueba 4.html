        <p>Looking for an adventure? Something fun to do in Haiti? Come visit Haiti's largest waterfall. Saut-D'eau is a big body of water that people visit for a special celebration in July. The annual event is called the Festival of the Lady of Carmel and takes place from July 14â€“16. Why do people celebrate? Well, it's more like a contemplation of the waterfall, but it consists of music, food, and spiritual contemplation. There is a myth that before the waterfall was made, the Virgin Mary visited the area in the apparition of a palm tree in the 19th century and started to heal the sick. Thanks to the rumors, Haitians came to visit her in search of blessings. Since the rumors were spread, a priest named Father Lenouve was angered because he considered the site to be superstitious yet not religious. As the priest cut the tree on his way back to his church, he felt nauseous and died the same day. People believe that the waterfall belongs to the Virgin Mary, making it very important for religious people in the area.
            People use the waterfall for Catholic and Voodoo baptism (the reason that a lot of people visit it) and enjoy the fresh water. Other types of activities would be walks and bird contemplation. That's right, bird contemplation. This is another reason why it is very popular in Haiti.
