        <p>On the island of Hispaniola between Haiti and Dominican Republic is the famous Artibonite River, the longest river in all of Haiti. Its name originates from the Taino tribe, the indigenous people that were the first to be “encountered” by Christopher Columbus during his 1492 voyage. In this river you can find some rare animal species such as the Limia fish, River crab, Ventriloquist frog and Mugiliformes fish.  

            Since it is the longest river in Hispaniola it is very important for the people who live in the area either for water supplies, irrigation, or farming. Many visitors like to take pictures of the awesome view and do activities like boat rides, walks, or relax on the shore with floats.
