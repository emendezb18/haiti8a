            On December 5, 1492, the European Christopher Colombus was the first to set foot in Haiti.He was the first man to discover a new part of the world, like the Americas and Haiti . Columbus was the man who gave the island of Hispaniola to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.He went to the island with some of his ship's crew and hundreds of natives who had been taken into slavery. He discovered the Hispaniola settlement to be completely destroyed and left his brothers Bartolomeo and Diego Columbus in charge of trying to rebuild it.
 
The island of Hispaniola was important to the Europeans because they colonized most of the Western Hemisphere. They were very successful because they found new land, new things, and this island that he found was very rich in agriculture, and also because they found so much gold on this island and in the Central and South Americas .
