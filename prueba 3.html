        <p>Pic La Selle is located in Morne la Selle, which is in the east of Haiti, with a height of more than 8,700 feet. Pic La Selle is the third highest mountain peak in the Caribbean and the highest mountain peak in Haiti. The La Selle range needs to be on your radar if you want to take risks. It is complicated to arrive there because the mountain is very steep, but if you have a four-by-four, you can make it. Luckily, youâ€™ll find guides who specialize in guiding hikes from city to summit.
            People who enjoy the outdoors but don't necessarily want to climb Pic La Selle will be drawn to this picturesque path because of its vegetation and more peaks and valleys. The mountains seem to fold and unfold in front of you indefinitely.
