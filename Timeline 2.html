        <p>Before Christopher Columbus stepped foot in Haiti, he was actually not alone. The Taino were indigenous people of the Caribbean. They arrived in 4000 BCE. They speak a difficult dialect that only they understand called Arawak. This group of indigenous people resisted all kinds of complications. They were very good at agriculture and hunting. The indigenous groups were easily conquered by the Spaniards beginning in 1493 and were also enslaved during the Haiti Revolution.
