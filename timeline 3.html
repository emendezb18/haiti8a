        <p>After the Haitian colonization, Toussant became general of the enslaved people, along with Dessalin and Henri Christophe. Toussaint Louverture was convinced into a meeting and put in prison after France, under Napoleon, gave back Haiti. He was transported to France, where he was held in jail and subjected to a continuous interview. In 1803, he died suddenly there from pneumonia and malnutrition. He was the son of an educated slave, learned to write and speak it poorly, and instead more often used Haitian Creole and African tribal languages.
            He became the cultivation manager's favorite to become a coachman, healer, and finally a steward. A guard in the French prison where Toussaint Louverture had been incarcerated for nearly eight months discovered his body early on the morning of April 7, 1803. A few months before his death, the leader of the Haitian revolution was saying that his cell was very cold and he had many ailments, but no one believed him, and they told him that he was complaining a lot and that he would be fine in that cell, but because at high temperatures he suffered several pulmonary complications that caused his death.
