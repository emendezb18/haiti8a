        <p>The Haiti Revolution began in 1791 and ended in 1804. Before the French landed in the western part of the island, the Spanish claimed the rest of it. They agreed to divide the land, but the problem was that Haiti was ten times smaller than the DR. That's why both countries speak different languages and experience different types of crises throughout the years. This was a result of the discrimination of Haitian and DR people by skin color and how they pronounce their language. Haiti and the DR always have some rivalries.
            This was so important to Haiti because after the island was divided and the haitian revolution took place they were the first free black people in the area, making them rule the Dominican Republic as well.
