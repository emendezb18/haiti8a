        <p>Food is one of them.Many visitors say that the different types of recipes are unique since some dishes can be similar to those of other countries and even then have a unique flavor. Pikliz, a salad based on onion, tomato, cabbage, and carrot, would be three classic dishes. But something else is spicy. In Haiti, spicy food can never be missing, especially if it is strong. If you go to any restaurant, most plates are served with the salad, so don't be surprised if you see it in every restaurant. Haitians like to make combinations of different types of food. This time it would be the pork bowl, which is a cup made of ripe and filled with pork, pikliz, or other things. Center it on the 3 famous dishes and remember that Haitian food is mostly spicy.
            Haiti has a variety of restaurants. There are too many good places to discover the food dishes that Haiti offers its tourists and citizens. The best restaurants in the country are close to the beach, and most of the food is fish or tropical, but they not only offer you sea food but also quantities of rice and portions of meat. An ideal place to enjoy the view of the sea and also some traditional dishes of the country is Cormier Plage, located in the north of the country. What more could you ask for? Breathe in the sea air with a good breakfast or enjoy the sound of the waves with a plate of freshly caught seafood using Cormier Plage's secret recipe.
